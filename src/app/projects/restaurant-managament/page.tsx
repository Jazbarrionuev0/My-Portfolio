            <p className="my-3">In our project, we placed a strong emphasis on delivering an exceptional user experience for both the end-users of the digital menu app and the administrators of the back-office system. Our design process prioritized intuitive navigation, clean and aesthetically pleasing interfaces, and responsive design to ensure seamless usability across all devices. For the digital menu, we focused on making the browsing and ordering process effortless and engaging for customers. Meanwhile, the back-office interface was crafted with user-friendly controls and comprehensive features, enabling restaurant staff to efficiently manage and update menu items, monitor orders, and gain insights through analytics. This dual focus on UX/UI ensured that both customers and administrators benefited from a smooth, efficient, and enjoyable experience.</p>
